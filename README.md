# Awesome-Energy-Based-Models
Selected papers I've read in the field of zero shot learning. Not a complete list of all accepted papers. I'll mainly focus on those papers with open-source implementations and most interesting to me. 

**Note**: *This list may contain understanding bias and personal preference. All that papers without available code will not provide a link to it.*
